                <p>For design enthusiasts, one of the most exciting parts of a new year is seeing what trends it brings.
                    And, fortunately, 2022 has no shortage of them, especially when it comes to the living room. Though
                    it's
                    always important to design a space in a way that feels best to you, trends are a great blueprint to
                    follow or simply an exciting way to jazz up a room that may have been feeling a little dull lately.

                <p>Bathrooms are often an overlooked part of the home, as they're typically not as glamorous (or
                    Instagram-able) as other spaces. But here at House Beautiful, we say: Why not? After all, bathrooms
                    are certainly rooms that everyone uses—which is why their design is just as important as, say, a
                    cozy living room. So, if 2022 will be the year you finally put some effort into upgrading yours,
                    we've got you prepared: Below, House Beautiful has rounded up a list of 10 bathroom trends you
                    should expect to see in 2022, including the return of scenic murals, plenty of plants, and mixing
                    and matching textures. With this as inspiration you won't go wrong in your bathroom reno.</p>

                <p>Over the last few years, dining room trends have changed dramatically. For the past 20 years they
                    have been out of fashion, with the popularity of open- and broken-plan layouts meaning they were
                    often knocked through and incorporated into other rooms.

                    But, as a result of the pandemic, there's an increased need for privacy in different spaces in the
                    house, and dining rooms have, according to real estate experts and interior designers, become one of
                    the most sought-after property features in 2022.

                    The once formal dining room that really was only used for dining is now doubling as a home office
                    for home workers or school work. What’s more, there is a general increase in the number of people
                    entertaining at home as we try to reclaim the lost social opportunities of the last few years.</p>
