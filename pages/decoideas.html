                <h3>LIVING ROOM</h3>
                <h4>1. Enhance a Backyard View</h4>
                <p>Working with landscape architect Lila Fendrick, designer Nestor Santa Cruz chose a wall of steel and
                    glass windows and doors for this formal pool house living room that leads to the backyard. Though the glass decor,
                    from the pendant light to the coffee table and doors, leaves a decidedly sleek impression, the plush rug
                    and ethereal curtains make it extra cozy, too.</p>
                    
                <h4>2. Work Around Restrictions</h4>
                <p>When designer Celerie Kemble moved into this New York City apartment, there was only one thing that prevented
                    it from being the perfect fit: The building had a no wallpaper rule. To work around that obstacle, she
                    applied a light shade of pink paint in a plaster-like finish that channels the texture of wallpaper.</p>
                        
                <h4>3. Mix Clean Lines With Casual Materials</h4>
                <p>In the living room of designer Devin Kirk, a light shade of blue-gray along with clean-lined furniture makes
                    for a polished backdrop while the woven chairs, light wood side table, and tree stump coffee table
                    ensure a laidback atmosphere. It's the perfect balance of approachable and formal.</p>
                            
                <h4>4. Incorporate Fun Trees and Plants</h4>
                <p>Invite some nods to nature into your living room with quirky indoor plants and trees. Designer Elizabeth
                    Cooper placed a lush citrus tree in the corner for an extra pop of life and color and then staggered
                    topiaries on the windowsill.</p>
                                
                <h4>5. Create Zones With Area Rugs</h4>
                <p>Invite some nods to nature into your living room with quirky indoor plants and trees. Designer Elizabeth

        <!-- KITCHEN CONTENT  -->
        <div class="row h-100 text-center">
            <div class="col">
                <h3>KITCHEN</h3>
                <h4>1. Make It Feel Extra Homey </h4>
                <p>Just because your kitchen doesn't get a ton of natural light doesn't mean it can't have a sunny
                    disposition. The cheerful yellow wallpaper in Shavonda Gardner's kitchen proves it. Featuring
                    unlacquered copper pots, soapstone counters that quickly patina, and a simple central dining table
                    instead of a kitchen island, the kitchen's lived-in atmosphere instantly makes anyone who enters feel
                    right at home.</p>

                <h4>2. Place Extra Chairs in Low-Traffic Corners</h4>
                <p>If the space is small, play around with fun wallpaper. Something with a little sheen will make the room
                    gleam... even if you haven't gotten to the dishes in, uh, a while. Sheila Bridges also opted for a
                    complementary fabric on these accent chairs to enhance the blues throughout and tucked them in a
                    low-traffic corner for convenience.</p>

                <h4>3. Use Statement Fabric for Seating</h4>
                <p>Designer Kristin Fine gave her classic farmhouse a modern twist with glossy zellige tiles on the walls,
                    Calacatta marble from ABC Stone on the counters, and vintage opaline pendants, black flush mounts, and
                    vintage stools reupholstered in a mossy Pierre Frey fabric. The exposed beams maintain the countryside
                    roots of the home and the pale green tones honor the forest views outside.</p>

                <h4>4. Start With One Accent Piece</h4>
                <p>This kitchen was designed around the homeowners's inherited ceramic collection. She told designer Andy
                    Beers of Ore Studios that she wanted the blue midcentury serve ware and tableware to anchor the entire
                    space, so they mixed in open cubbies and added splashes of red for a vibrant yet straightforward color
                    palette.</p>

                <h4>5. Remodel Cabinet Uppers to Optimize Storage</h4>
                <p>If your kitchen wall is lined with windows, consider adding a pretty treatment that doesn't totally block
                    the light, like cafe curtains, and make sure your lower cabinets can take care of most of the storage
                    needs. This way, you can forgo lining the wall with uppers. Instead, install one strategic column. Heidi
                    Caillier customized the open shelves for cookbooks, plates, drinkware, and even artwork.</p>

            <div class="col">
                <h3>BATH ROOM</h3>
                <h4>1. Open Plan </h4>
                <p>This bold minimalist open plan double shower and bath from interior designer Cathie Hong of Cathie Hong
                    Interiors has pivoting glass doors that can be left open to maximize light and air flow from the
                    wrap-around windows, or shut to prevent unwanted shower splashes. Double showerheads are discreetly
                    installed on opposite sides of the self-enclosed wash room, keeping the focus on the tub and the view.</p>

                <h4>2. Double Wall-Mounted Sinks</h4>
                <p>Not every shared bathroom needs a built-in double vanity. In this child's shared bathroom from JL Design,
                    matching wall-mounted industrial sinks are hung at kid-friendly height to give siblings their own space.</p>

                <h4>3. Wall Tile</h4>
                <p>Covering bathroom walls in floor-to-ceiling stone or tiling has become a widespread design trend that is
                    practical from a cleaning perspective and has the visual advantage of drawing the eye upward to make
                    bathrooms feel more spacious.</p>

                <h4>4. Lighting</h4>
                <p>Installing good lighting is an important part of any room design, but bathroom lighting can often be
                    harsh and unflattering in the room where you least want it to be. In this bathroom from interior
                    designer Rhianna Jones of Tidal Interiors, LED backlighting adds a glamorous touch to a sleek built-in
                    wall-to-wall shower niche. The ambient light creates a soothing glow for nighttime showers and adds
                    another layer of lighting in a space lacking in natural light. If attempting to add light to a shower,
                    be sure to enlist a professional who can ensure that it's safe and waterproof.</p>

                <h4>5. Upcycled Vanity</h4>
                <p>When choosing a bathroom vanity, consider upcycling a vintage or antique wood piece of furniture and
                    adding a sink and waterproof countertop. Interior designer Abbie Naber of A. Naber Design upcycled a
                    midcentury modern buffet into a handsome bathroom vanity with character and plenty of storage.</p>

                <h3>BED ROOM</h3>
                <h4>1. Cozy Built-in Bed Nook</h4>
                <p>In their New York cottage, Sea Roost, Mate Gallery owners Matt Albiani and Ron Brand transformed the
                    small bedroom into a dreamy coastal retreat by building a cozy captain's bed that they then surrounded
                    with vintage indigo textiles and topped with an indigo-inspired wallpaper.</p>

                <h4>2. Small Space Storage</h4>
                <p>You would never guess that this bright and airy all white bedroom measures only 170 square feet! Painting
                    the planked ceiling, shiplapped walls, and trim all the same crisp, clean white was key to achieving
                    this deceivingly spacious look.</p>

                <h4>3. Statement Headboard</h4>
                <p>In her master bedroom, style blogger and author Liz Marie Galvan (@lizmariegalvan) chose a
                    mantel-inspired headboard to add architectural interest against the plain white walls. A chunky
                    cable-knit throw atop layers of subtle striped bedding provides softness.</p>

                <h4>4. Mixing Patterns</h4>
                <p>For a bedroom that really pops, like this Texas guest room, start by painting your walls and trim a crisp
                    white. Then bring in graphic patterns through a rug and upholstered headboard. Topping the bed with all
                    white bedding helps the patterns pop even more. Tip: Choose pieces of similar colors to keep the look
                    tailored and sophisticated.</p>

                <h4>5. Salvaged Headboard</h4>
                <p>For a unique headboard, stylist Matthew Gleason turned a salvaged door on its side. To keep installation
                    easy, attach the door directly to the wall and pair with a simple platform bed.</p>

        <div class="row h-100 text-center">
            <div class="col">
                <h3>DINING ROOM</h3>
                <h4>1. Balance Warmth With Formality</h4>
                <p>A matching table and chair set creates cohesion in this eclectic dining nook designed by Ariene Bethea.
                    Bolster pillows and custom throws make the corner nook extra cozy and multi-purpose. Though it feels
                    tailored, it's still approachable and warm.</p>

                <h4>2. Separate Zones With Ceiling Wallpaper</h4>
                <p>A sunny shade of sisal wallpaper connects the open kitchen to the dining room and separates it from the
                    seating area in this great room designed by Halden Interiors.</p>

                <h4>3. Think Outside the Obvious Layout Options</h4>
                <p>An offset, extra-large circular table flatters the shape of the window nook without appearing too
                    cramped, as it's not crammed right up against the windows nor smack dab in the middle of the room. While
                    the colors are muted and the materials are understated, the goemtric shapes throughout add tons of
                    intrigue.</p>

                <h4>4. Enable Indoor/Outdoor Flow</h4>
                <p>Kingston Lafferty Design created an indoor/outdoor dining room by extending a built-in table on both ends
                    of the wall. They're connected by a large window with accordion glass doors for seamless flow when
                    larger parties are dining and visually by the glossy tiles. Visually, they're a stylish statement and
                    outside, a durable, weatherproof material. Plants also make the two spaces feel like they're in
                    conversation with each other.</p>

                <h4>5. Customize a Banquette</h4>
                <p>Custom back cushions that match the seats create both cohesion and comfort in this dining nook designed
                    by Studio Shamshiri. The wooden wall paneling warms up the darker elements and also reflects the more
                    casual chairs across the table.</p>
